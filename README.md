# Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was for a client so they can analyze their stock data set at the click of a button. At first, the client wanted to analyze a single stock in the set, but then decided to expand into multiple stocks over multiple years. 

## Results

# Challenge Overview
The stock analysis worked very well for a few of the stocks, but if it was expanded for the entire stock market, it might take a while to compute. The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the code so that it will run quicker.

## Challenge Results


# Summary

This code helped develop a simple volume report for multiple stocks on the stock market over a couple years. When working with the original code, the developers decided to refactor the code to help it run faster. This is great because it updates the codes and typically uses less lines, making the code more easily understandable. During the process of refactoring, however, it is easy to lose your place and if you leave the code in the middle of refactoring, one is likely to forget where the changes were made. This makes refactoring code very tedious and time consuming. 

The original code was easy enough to understand.
